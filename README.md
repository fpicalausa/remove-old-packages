# Remove Stale Branches

This Github Action will identify old packages and remove them

By default, packages are identified as stale if they were created more than 90 days ago.
This is useful to avoid free up space used by your github packages.

# How it works?

This Action look for all the versions of a given package in a given organization.
If the package is old, and is not one of the latest versions, it will remove it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èüí£ CAUTION

Without setting `dry_run: true`, this action will remove packages. Consider setting `dry_run: true` until you are happy with how this action works.
